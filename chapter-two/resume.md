# What did i learn?

This chapter is about which text editor best suits Clojure developement.
The book pointed out several reasons explaining why you should use emacs text editor. But the most important one was
about being able to test your code using the repl. I've found out there are lot of text editors able to do that
nowdays. So if you don't want to spend time learing how to use emacs, you can just stick with your favorite one
which i guess should probably have support for clojure developement.

For stubborn guys like me, wanting to suffer learning new text editor,
